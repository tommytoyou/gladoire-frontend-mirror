            Four stages, called (in Sanskrit) <b>dhyanas</b> or (in Pali) <b>jhanas</b>, are 
            distinguished in the shift of attention from the outward sensory world:
            <ul>
                <li>First we experience a detachment from the external world and a consciousness of joy and ease, </li> 
                <li>Then a concentration, with suppression of reasoning and investigation, </li>
                <li>Followed by the passing away of joy, with the sense of ease remaining, and </li>
                <li>Culminating in the passing away of ease also, bringing about a state of pure self-possession and equanimity.</li>
